                            YouTube channel from March 2017 to May 2019. As a Mathematics Educator, I created
                            educational videos aimed at helping students prepare for the Joint Entrance Examination
                            (JEE) in India. The videos covered various topics in JEE Mathematics, and were designed to
                            provide clear explanations, worked-out examples, and problem-solving strategies.

                            Overall, my experience running the SCV Classes YouTube channel allowed me to develop my
                            skills as a Mathematics Educator and content creator. I honed my ability to explain complex
                            concepts in a clear and concise manner, and learned how to engage with my audience
                            effectively. I am proud of the impact my videos have had on the education of JEE aspirants,
                            and am eager to continue creating high-quality educational content in the future. </p>
